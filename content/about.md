### :woman_technologist: About me

My curiosity pushes me to constantly learn, discover and pursue different aspects of technology; web and mobile development, programming, human-computer interaction concepts, machine learning and artificial intelligence. My ultimate goal is to use my knowledge to help in contributing and molding the human experience.

Currently, I work as a front-end engineer. My focus is mostly on building and maintaining e-commerce websites using React/Redux.
